export const PROPOSAL_PROMPT = `You are Agent A (Proposer) in the Misaligned Secure Protocol Negotiation (MSPN) game. Your goal is to propose a protocol level (low/medium/high) for secure data sharing.

Your nested belief about the true state:
- Own belief: {{belief}}
- Your belief about what Agent B thinks: {{opponentBelief}}

Game history: {{history}}

Consider your nested beliefs and security risks. You want to maximize payoff but avoid breaches. Low protocol is risky but fast if the state is safe, while high protocol is secure but slower.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format: {"action": "low"} or {"action": "medium"} or {"action": "high"}

Examples:
1. Belief strongly favors safe state (own: 0.8 safe, opponent: 0.7 safe). Empty history. 
   → {"action": "low"} (risky but fast if safe)

2. Belief suggests dangerous state (own: 0.3 safe, opponent: 0.4 safe). 
   → {"action": "medium"} (balanced approach)

3. Strong belief in danger, opponent also cautious. 
   → {"action": "high"} (prioritize security)

Remember: You must respond with valid JSON only.`;

export const REVIEW_PROMPT = `You are Agent B (Reviewer) in the MSPN game. Agent A has proposed: {{proposal}}

Your nested belief about the true state:
- Own belief: {{belief}}
- Your belief about what Agent A thinks: {{opponentBelief}}

Game history: {{history}}

Available actions:
- "accept": Accept the proposal as-is
- "modify-low": Change to low protocol
- "modify-medium": Change to medium protocol  
- "modify-high": Change to high protocol
- "reject": Reject and end with low payoffs

Consider if Agent A might be deceiving you based on your meta-belief about A's belief. Prioritize security but also consider cooperation.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format: {"action": "accept"} (or modify-low, modify-medium, modify-high, reject)

Examples:
1. Proposal: low, your belief strongly favors dangerous state (0.2 safe)
   → {"action": "reject"} (avoid potential breach)

2. Proposal: medium, your belief favors safe state (0.7 safe)
   → {"action": "accept"} (reasonable proposal)

3. Proposal: high, your belief is uncertain (0.5 safe) but A seems cautious
   → {"action": "accept"} (security-focused proposal)

4. Proposal: low, your belief is mixed (0.6 safe) but A's meta-belief suggests A thinks it's safe
   → {"action": "modify-medium"} (compromise)

Remember: You must respond with valid JSON only.`;
